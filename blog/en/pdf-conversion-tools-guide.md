## PDF to JPG Conversion

### How PDF to JPG Conversion Works

Our [PDF to JPG converter](https://qubittool.com/en/tools/pdf-to-jpg) renders each page of your PDF as a high-quality JPG image. The process:

1. **Upload**: Select your PDF file (up to 50MB)
2. **Configure**: Adjust quality (1-100%) and scale (1x-4x)
3. **Convert**: Each page is rendered to a separate image
4. **Download**: Get individual images or all pages as a ZIP file

### Quality and Scale Settings

**Quality Setting (1-100%)**:
- 85-95%: Best balance of quality and file size
- 70-80%: Good for web thumbnails
- 95-100%: Maximum quality for printing

**Scale Setting (1x-4x)**:
- 1x: Standard resolution (72 DPI equivalent)
- 2x: High resolution (144 DPI equivalent) - recommended
- 3x-4x: Very high resolution for large prints

### Tips for Best Results

- Use 2x scale for most purposes
- Higher scale = larger file sizes
- JPG quality of 90% is usually sufficient
- For text-heavy PDFs, consider higher scale for readability

## PDF to Text Extraction

### How Text Extraction Works

Our [PDF to Text extractor](https://qubittool.com/en/tools/pdf-to-text) reads the text layer from your PDF and outputs it as plain text. The process:

1. **Upload**: Select your PDF file
2. **Process**: Text is extracted from each page
3. **Review**: View extracted text organized by page
4. **Export**: Copy to clipboard or download as TXT file

### Understanding PDF Text Layers

PDFs can contain text in different ways:

1. **Selectable Text**: Text that can be copied directly - our tool extracts this perfectly
2. **Scanned Images**: Text that's actually an image - requires OCR (not supported)
3. **Mixed Content**: Combination of both types

### Limitations

- **Scanned PDFs**: If your PDF is a scanned document, the text is actually an image and cannot be extracted without OCR
- **Complex Layouts**: Tables, columns, and complex formatting may not be perfectly preserved
- **Fonts**: Some embedded fonts may affect extraction accuracy

## Best Practices for PDF Conversion

### Before Converting

1. **Check PDF Quality**: Higher quality source PDFs produce better results
2. **Verify Text Type**: Ensure text is selectable, not scanned
3. **Consider File Size**: Large PDFs may take longer to process
4. **Backup Original**: Always keep your original PDF file

### Optimizing Output

**For Images (PDF to JPG)**:
- Start with 2x scale and 90% quality
- Increase scale for documents with small text
- Reduce quality for web use to save bandwidth

**For Text (PDF to Text)**:
- Review extracted text for accuracy
- Check page breaks and formatting
- Use text editor to clean up if needed

### Security Considerations

Our tools process files entirely in your browser:
- Files are never uploaded to our servers
- Processing happens locally on your device
- Your documents remain private and secure

### Can I convert a multi-page PDF to images?

Yes! Our converter processes all pages in your PDF and creates a separate JPG image for each page. You can download them individually or as a convenient ZIP file.

### Why can't I extract text from my PDF?

If your PDF is a scanned document, the text is actually an image. Our tool extracts text from PDFs with selectable text. For scanned documents, you would need an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tool.

### What's the best quality setting for PDF to JPG?

For most purposes, 85-95% quality provides excellent results with reasonable file sizes. Use higher quality (95-100%) for printing or when image clarity is critical.

### Is my PDF secure when using these tools?

Yes! All processing happens in your browser. Your files are never uploaded to our servers, ensuring complete privacy and security.

### Can I convert password-protected PDFs?
