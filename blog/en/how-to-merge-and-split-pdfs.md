## Why Merge PDF Files?

Merging PDFs means combining multiple separate files into one. This is incredibly useful for:

- **Compiling Reports:** Combine a cover page, introduction, data sections, and appendix into a single, professional report.
- **Submitting Applications:** Merge your resume, cover letter, and portfolio into one file for a job or school application.
- **Organizing Invoices:** Keep all invoices from a specific client or project together.
- **Creating Portfolios:** Assemble different case studies or project examples into a unified portfolio.

A merged PDF is professional, organized, and easy to navigate.

## Why Split PDF Files?

Splitting a PDF means extracting pages from a larger document to create a new, smaller one. This is perfect for:

- **Extracting Key Information:** Pull just the chapter you need from a textbook or the relevant clauses from a long legal contract.
- **Sharing Specific Sections:** Send a client only the relevant pages of a proposal.
- **Reducing File Size:** A smaller file is easier to email or upload.
- **Separating Records:** Split a single PDF containing multiple invoices into individual files.

Splitting PDFs saves time and protects sensitive information by only sharing what's necessary.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. Is it safe to use online PDF merger and splitter tools?**
Yes, our tools are secure. We use encrypted connections to upload and process your files, and we automatically delete all files from our servers after a short period. Your privacy is guaranteed.

**2. Is there a limit to the number of files I can merge?**
Our PDF Merger allows you to upload and combine up to 20 PDF files at once, which is more than enough for most reports, applications, and projects.

**3. Can I rearrange the pages within a PDF before merging?**
While you can arrange the order of the *files* you upload, our current tool does not support rearranging individual *pages* within those files. For page-level organization, it is best to prepare your PDFs beforehand.

**4. When splitting a PDF, can I select a range of pages?**
Absolutely. Our PDF Splitter allows you to select individual pages, multiple non-consecutive pages, or a continuous range of pages (e.g., pages 5-12) to extract.

**5. Do I need to install any software?**
No. Both our PDF Merger and PDF Splitter are fully browser-based. There is nothing to download or install, so you can manage your documents from any device with an internet connection.
